    <h1>How Deep Is the Mariana Trench and What Have We Found in its Depths?</h1>
    <p>The ocean is unfathomably deep. So deep that the Mariana Trench, hidden beneath the ocean’s waves, would surpass Mount Everest in height, if our planet’s tallest mountain were placed inside it upside down.</p>
    <p>Remarkably, a host of unique sea creatures survive and thrive in the Mariana Trench and a handful of humans in submersibles have also endured daunting expeditions to its floor. Their journeys continue to unravel the mysteries of this hidden underwater world.</p>
    <h2>What Is the Mariana Trench?</h2>
    <p>The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the world’s oceans, located in the western Pacific Ocean. The weight of the ocean above it creates pressure around 15,750 pounds per square inch (more than 1,000 times what we experience on land) and the alien world is devoid of light. </p>
    <h2>Where Is the Mariana Trench?</h2>
    <p>It is located to the east of the Mariana Islands, a chain of volcanic islands, where it gets its name. Typical water temperatures hover just a few degrees above freezing. Despite the extreme pressure, lack of light, and frigid temperatures, the Mariana Trench hosts a variety of life forms. These include microorganisms, as well as larger organisms like amphipods, and possibly even fish, adapted to the extreme conditions.</p>
